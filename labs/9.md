# Canary Deployments
A common practice is to deploy a new version of an application to a small subset of the available clusters. Using *Kustomize* again we will modify the pacman image and then promote that image to be running on all clusters.

Ensure that the pacman application is still running in all 3 clusters.
~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3;do echo "*** $cluster ***"; oc get deployment --context $cluster -n pacman;done

*** cluster1 ***
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   1/1     1            1           6m21s
*** cluster2 ***
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   1/1     1            1           6m21s
*** cluster3 ***
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
pacman   1/1     1            1           6m21s
~~~

We would first like to ensure that cluster3 has the new container image configured. To do this we will modify the file `~/federation-dev/labs/lab-7-assets/overlays/cluster1/07-pacman-deployment-rs.yaml`.

~~~sh
cd ~/federation-dev/labs/lab-7-assets/overlays/cluster3
cat > 07-pacman-deployment-rs.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    name: pacman
  name: pacman
  namespace: pacman
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: pacman
    spec:
      serviceAccount: pacman
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest
        name: pacman
EOF
~~~

Commit the changes to the repository so that Argo CD can make the changes.

~~~sh
git commit -am 'Update pacman container image for Cluster3'
git push origin master
~~~

We will run the sync command to speed up the process of deploying the new image.
~~~sh
argocd app sync cluster3-pacman
~~~

Validate that the image successfully deployed. You should see the out of `quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest`.
~~~sh
oc get deployment -n pacman pacman  --context cluster3 -o=jsonpath='{$.spec.template.spec.containers[:1].image}'
~~~

Because we know that the application deploys and passes startup procedures successfully then we know we can supply the image to the other clusters.
~~~sh
cd ~/federation-dev/labs/lab-7-assets/base
sed -i 's~quay.io/ifont/pacman-nodejs-app:latest~quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest~g' 07-pacman-deployment-rs.yaml
~~~

Before committing the code to the git repository and deploying the code. We need to set cluster3's application deployment back to the original values since the image will be defined from the base directory now.
~~~sh
cd ~/federation-dev/labs/lab-7-assets/overlays
\cp -f cluster1/07-pacman-deployment-rs.yaml cluster3/07-pacman-deployment-rs.yaml
~~~

Now we will submit the changes to our git repo which should deploy the new image to all clusters.
~~~sh
git commit -am 'new image to all clusters'
git push origin master
~~~

We will run the sync command which will place the new pacman image in all three clusters.

~~~sh
argocd app sync cluster1-pacman
argocd app sync cluster2-pacman
argocd app sync cluster3-pacman
~~~

Verify the image deployed is our newest pacman image.

~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1 cluster2 cluster3;do echo "$cluster "; oc get deployment --context $cluster -n pacman pacman -o=jsonpath='{$.spec.template.spec.containers[:1].image}'; echo "";done

cluster1 
quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest
cluster2 
quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest
cluster3 
quay.io/rcook/pacman-nodejs-app-pipeline:latest
