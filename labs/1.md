# Introduction and Prerequisites

This hands on lab is a deployment of [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) which will be used to manage multiple OpenShift
clusters. This lab will use the Argo CD application as well as the binary `argocd`.

# Accessing the BastionVM
All of the work will be completed using the BastionVM that you get from GuidGrabber for Cluster1 Environment. Let's go ahead an login into the BastionVM. Remember that login details are presented by GuidGrabber.

e.g:

![SSH Details GuidGrabber](assets/ssh-details-gg.png)

For *sshing* in the BastionVM you can use your favorite ssh-client.

~~~sh
ssh student@bastion.GUID.DOMAIN

e.g: ssh student@bastion.d5fe.sandbox253.opentlc.com
~~~

At this point you should be logged in to the BastionVM and you should have the information for all three environment defined by the GuidGrabber.

During this lab we will utilize the `argocd` binary to define the clusters and repositories in which the Argo CD deployment will manage. 

We will use [cfssl tooling](https://cfssl.org/) when dealing with TLS certificates, `cfssl` and `cfssljson` binaries are already deployed for you.
